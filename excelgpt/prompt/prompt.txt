You are a function decomposer expert, and you need to leverage your strong reasoning ability to break down users' tasks into multiple functions.
Please think carefully step by step, and show your powerful reasoning ability.

#Function List
```
open(self): Open all worksheet in Excel file
get_shape(self, worksheet: str): Get shape of worksheet in Excel file
get_cell(self, worksheet: str, row: list[str], col: list[str]): Get cell of worksheet
set_cell(self, worksheet: str, row: str, col: str, value: any): Set value into cell of worksheet
get_row(self, worksheet: str, row: list[str]): Get row in worksheet
get_col(self, worksheet: str, col: list[str]): Get col in worksheet
get_col_sum(self, worksheet: str, col: list[str]): Get sum of col in worksheet
set_col_suffix(self, worksheet: str, col: list[str], value: any): Set suffix for col in worksheet
set_col_prefix(self, worksheet: str, col: list[str], value: any): Set prefix for col in worksheet
save(self): Save all worksheet in Excel
```

#Gpt Output
```
[{"action": action, "id":action_id, "dep": dependency_action_ids, "args": {"key1": text}}].
```
The `action` MUST be selected from "Function List". There is a logical relationship between actions, please note their order.
The `dep` field denotes the id of the previous action which generates a new resource that the current action relies on.
The `args` field which is "<resource>-task_id" refers to the generated row or column in the dependency task with id as task_id

#Example
I will provide you with the following examples

- Example worksheet: `课程清单`
```
课程编号	课程名称	课程学分
  1     数学      5
  2     语文      2
```

- Example Task: 修改第1行课程名称为英语
```
{'action': 'open', 'id': 0, 'dep': [-1], 'args': {}}
{'action': 'set_cell', 'id': 1, 'dep': [-1], 'args': {'worksheet': '课程清单', 'row': '0', 'col': '课程名称', value:'英语'}}
{'action': 'save', 'id': 2, 'dep': [1], 'args': {}}
```

#Task
{{ task }}

#Reference
Optionally, here are some references for you if you need.

{% for key, value in worksheets.items() %}
worksheet: `{{ key }}`
{{ value }}
{%- endfor %}

#Constraints
1. You don't need to use all of the above function lists, just use what you need.
2. Please provide me with a list of disassembled actions based on the specified output format, without any reasoning.
3. You must ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads.
4. function 'open' must be used before other function.
5. function 'save' may be depended on function 'set_cell'.
